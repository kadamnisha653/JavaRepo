Constructor: special type of method used for initializing the object.
It is called when the instance of an class is created.
When constructor is called, memory for the object is allocated.

It is not compulsion to create a constructor because java compiler creates a default constructor when an object is created.

Create a constructor:

Rules: 1. constructor's name should be same as class name.
2. constructor don't have return types.
3. constructor cannot be static, final, abstract.

for e.g. If my classname is Person, then constructor would look like:

Person()
{
	body of the constructor;
}

Two types:
	Default constructor (without parameters)
	Parameterized constructor
